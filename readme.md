# ROC-AUC support

In many cases I have been interested to calculate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under corve auc (AUC)
and this package for calculating statistical tests has been really nice. This is simple fork for the outdated and not anymore
mainteined package, to include ROC-AUC curves.

Here is a minimal example:
Usage is identical to the original package with few additional things:
1. set the test='AUC'
2. text_format='auc' (it works without this but then figures show "p=your auc value)
3. comparisons_correction=None, which is now default parameter (this is mandatory, since the Bonferroni correction makes no sense for AUC values, in the current implementation)

```python
import seaborn as sns
from statannot import add_stat_annotation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = sns.load_dataset("tips")
x = "day"
y = "total_bill"
order = ['Sun', 'Thur', 'Fri', 'Sat']
ax = sns.boxplot(data=df, x=x, y=y, order=order)
test_results = add_stat_annotation(ax, data=df, x=x, y=y, order=order,
                                   box_pairs=[("Thur", "Fri"), ("Thur", "Sat"), ("Fri", "Sun")],
                                   test='AUC', text_format='auc', comparisons_correction=None,
                                   loc='outside', verbose=2)
test_results
plt.show()
```

# END of my forked modifications

# Disclaimer

**This repository is not maintained anymore**. I recommend using the forked package [trevismd/statannotations](https://github.com/trevismd/statannotations), which has a cleaner API and further extends the functionalities of `statannot`.

## What is it

Python package to optionnally compute statistical test and add statistical annotations on an existing boxplot/barplot generated by seaborn.

## Features

- Single function to add statistical annotations on an existing boxplot/barplot generated by seaborn boxplot.
- Integrated statistical tests (binding to `scipy.stats` methods):
    - Mann-Whitney
    - t-test (independent and paired)
    - Welch's t-test
    - Levene test
    - Wilcoxon test
    - Kruskal-Wallis test
- Smart layout of multiple annotations with correct y offsets.
- Annotations can be located inside or outside the plot.
- Format of the statistical test annotation can be customized: star annotation, simplified p-value, or explicit p-value.
- Optionally, custom p-values can be given as input. In this case, no statistical test is performed.

## Installation

The latest stable release can be installed from PyPI:

```python
pip install statannot
```
You may instead want to use the development version from Github:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/webermarcolivier/statannot.git
```

## Documentation

See example jupyter notebook `example/example.ipynb`.

## Usage

Here is a minimal example:

```python
import seaborn as sns
from statannot import add_stat_annotation

df = sns.load_dataset("tips")
x = "day"
y = "total_bill"
order = ['Sun', 'Thur', 'Fri', 'Sat']
ax = sns.boxplot(data=df, x=x, y=y, order=order)
test_results = add_stat_annotation(ax, data=df, x=x, y=y, order=order,
                                   box_pairs=[("Thur", "Fri"), ("Thur", "Sat"), ("Fri", "Sun")],
                                   test='Mann-Whitney', text_format='star',
                                   loc='outside', verbose=2)
test_results
```

More examples are available in the jupyter notebook `example/example.ipynb`.
